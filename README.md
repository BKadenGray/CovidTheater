# CovidTheater

The idea behind this project is to be able to fill a theater for a showing while respecting Covid Guidelines setup.

The person using the program can:
```
  - Create the Rows and Columns for the event
  - Price each individual seat
  - Determine if a specific seat is available
  - Find any seat available by price
  - Setup reservations
  - Print current availability
```

The program itself is setup in a menu fashion allowing for multiple uses and reservations.
